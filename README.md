# House Prices Prediction

This repository contains code and resources for predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques. The project is part of a Kaggle competition that aims to predict the final prices of homes based on various features.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict house prices. The dataset includes various features such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on house sales in King County, USA. It includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/koke3/House_-Prices_prediction.git
    cd House_-Prices_prediction
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Run the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Model

The model used in this project is a regression model trained using various algorithms. Feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques are applied to improve the accuracy of the model.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results

The final model achieves a good balance between bias and variance, providing accurate predictions on the test dataset.
